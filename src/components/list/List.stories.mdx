# List and List Items

The `List` and `ListItem` components were developed to display multiple lines in a vertical layout that merge seamlessly into a single continuous element. 
They are ideal for displaying homogeneous data types in the form of rows of information, such as a contact list, a playlist or a menu. 
Each line, referred to as a `ListItem`, contains specific details or content relevant to the context of the list. 
In addition, the `ListItem` component retains its usefulness outside the boundaries of a list and offers flexibility for use in different components and interfaces.



## Arguments

<ArgTypes of={List} />

## Examples

export const BasicTemplate = (args) => (
  <List {...args}>
    <ListItem clickable={true}>abc</ListItem>
    <ListItem>def</ListItem>
  </List>
);

<Canvas>
  <Story args={{ bordered: true, separator: true }} name="Basic">
    {BasicTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
