Badges are often used to indicate status, notifications, or other contextual information within an interface. 
They can be styled and customized to suit various design requirements.

## Usage

- **Status Indicators**: Badges can be used to indicate the status of an item, such as "New," "Completed," or "In Progress."

- **Notification Counters**: Badges can display counts to indicate the number of unread messages, notifications, or pending tasks.

- **Dynamic Content**: Badges can be dynamically updated to reflect changes in the application state, such as the number of items in a shopping cart or the number of new messages.

- **Labels**: Badges can serve as labels for categorization or tagging purposes, helping users quickly identify and filter content.

- **Visual Enhancements**: Badges can enhance the visual appeal of a user interface by adding decorative elements or highlighting important information.
